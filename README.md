## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This project follows **Clean Architecture** principles with clear separation of concerns across five distinct layers:

### **Presentation Layer**
- Handles HTTP requests and responses
- API controllers and endpoints
- Request/Response models and validation

### **Service Layer**
- Business logic orchestration
- Service interfaces and implementations
- Cross-cutting concerns management

### **Core Layer**
- **CQRS pattern** implementation with MediatR
- Command and Query handlers
- DTOs and AutoMapper profiles
- Advanced filtering and pagination logic

### **Domain Layer**
- Core business entities and aggregates
- Domain enums and value objects
- Business rules and domain logic
- Domain events

### **Infrastructure Layer**
- **Entity Framework Core** database context
- Repository pattern implementations
- External service integrations:
  - **Memory Cache** for performance optimization
  - **Paymob** payment gateway integration
  - **MailKit** email services
  - **Azure Translation API** for multi-language support
- Configuration and data seeding

This architecture ensures **testability**, **maintainability**, and **independence** from frameworks and databases.
